A program for multi-format conversion of in vivo MRS to the [NIfTI-MRS format](https://github.com/wexeee/mrs_nifti_standard).

## About

This program was inspired by the imaging DICOM to NIfTI converter [dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix) developed by Chris Rorden. All MRS(I) orientations are tested with images converted using dcm2niix. I consider the combination of images converted using dcm2niix and displayed in [FSLeyes](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLeyes) the de facto standard.

## Citing Spec2nii

If you use `spec2nii` or the [NIfTI-MRS](https://github.com/wexeee/mrs_nifti_standard) format in your work please cite:

    `Clarke WT, Bell TK, Emir UE, Mikkelsen M, Oeltzschner G, Shamaei A, Soher BJ, Wilson M. NIfTI-MRS: A standard data format for magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Magn Reson Med. 2022. doi: 10.1002/mrm.29418.`

## Visualising output

Visualisation of MRS data converted by spec2nii to NIfTI-MRS can be carried out with a recent (>0.31.0) version of FSLeyes. A FSLeyes plugin for NIfTI-MRS is now available:
- [Gitlab](https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/wclarke/fsleyes-plugin-mrs),
- `conda install -c conda-forge fsleyes-plugin-mrs`,
- `pip install fsleyes-plugin-mrs`.

## Installation
`conda install -c conda-forge spec2nii`
or
`pip install spec2nii`

### Installing Conda (option #1)
Miniconda can be installed by following the instructions on the [Conda website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). To create a suitable environment run the following three commands after installing Conda.

```
    conda create -c conda-forge -n my_env python=3.8
    conda activate my_env
    conda install -c conda-forge spec2nii
```

## Currently supported formats
This table lists the currently supported formats. I have very limited experience with Philips and GE formats. Please get in touch if you are willing to help add to this list and/or supply validation data.

† Partial handling - see section on Twix pathway for MRSI handling.

## Instructions
spec2nii is called on the command line, and the conversion file type is specified with a subcommand.

The -f and -o options specify output file name and directory respectively for all formats.

If -j is specified the NIfTI MRS header extension will also be generated as a JSON side car file.

By default, spec2nii generates NIfTI files using the NIfTI-2 header format. Use the `--nifti1` option to generate files using the NIfTI-1 format.

Manual overrides can be provided for incorrectly interpreted required header fields, namely SpectrometerFrequency, ResonantNucleus and dwell-time, by using the `--override_frequency`, `--override_nucleus`, and `--override_dwelltime` command line options.

### Automatic detection
`spec2nii auto FILE` will attempt an automatic conversion of the following formats: Twix, RDA, SPAR/SDAT, GE p-file, DICOM. Note that many features of the individual converters are not implemented in this automatic pathway. This feature should be regarded as somewhat experimental. For finer-grained control see the specific subcommands listed below.

### Twix
Call `spec2nii twix -v FILE` to view a list of contained MDH flags. -m can be used to specify which multi-raid file to convert if used on VE data.

Call with the -e flag to specify which MDH flag to convert. e.g.
`spec2nii twix -e image FILE`

Twix format loop variables (e.g. `Ave` or `ida`) can be assigned to specific NIfTI dimensions using the `-d{5,6,7}` command line options. NIfTI MRS dimension tags (e.g. `DIM_COIL`) can be specified using the `-t{5,6,7}` command line options.

As `spec2nii` is __not__ a reconstruction program, it cannot convert MRSI data. Far too little information is held in the twix headers to reconstruct arbitrary k,t-space data. However, if passed a file containing MRSI data `spec2nii` will attempt to create an empty NIfTI-MRS file with the correct orientation information, data shape, and header information. This empty file can then have data inserted from an offline reconstruction routine.

### Siemens DICOM
`spec2nii dicom DCM_FILE_or_DIR`

NIfTI MRS dimension tags (e.g. `DIM_COIL`) can be specified using the `-t` command line argument.

### Siemens RDA
`spec2nii rda RDA_FILE`

Only supports SVS currently. Please contact the developers with examples for MRSI capability.
Orientation calculation is a WIP, test data for different voxel orientations would be greatly appreciated!

### UIH DICOM
`spec2nii uih DCM_FILE_or_DIR`

NIfTI MRS dimension tags (e.g. `DIM_COIL`) can be specified using the `-t` command line argument.

### GE
`spec2nii ge FILE`

### Philips (SPAR/SDAT)
`spec2nii philips SDAT_FILE SPAR_FILE`

Two optional arguments are available for the SPAR/SDAT pathway:
- `-t/--tags` allows the user to specify the dimension tags for each of the higher dimensions (up to three).
- `-s/--shape` allows the user to perform Numpy style reshaping of multiple transients. By default (without specifying a shape) all transients will be listed in a single 5th dimension.

### Philips (data/list)
Must be provided along side a matching SPAR file.
`spec2nii philips_dl DATA_FILE LIST_FILE SPAR_FILE`

### Philips DICOM
`spec2nii philips_dcm DCM_FILE_or_DIR`

NIfTI MRS dimension tags (e.g. `DIM_COIL`) can be specified using the `-t` command line argument.

Generates separate reference file if present.

Both classic and enhanced DICOM is handled.

### Bruker (2dseq/fid)
`spec2nii bruker -m 2DSEQ 2DSEQ_FILE_or_DIR`
`spec2nii bruker -m FID FID_FILE_or_DIR`

Use the `-d` option to dump the header files (method and acqp for fid, visu_pars for 2dseq) into the header extension.

Additional filters can be added by defining additional queries using the `-q` flag.

Bruker conversion is powered by the [BrukerAPI package](https://github.com/isi-nmr/brukerapi-python) written by Tomas Psorn.

### Varian
`spec2nii varian /path/to/fid.fid`
where fid.fid is a Varian fid directory containing a fid and procpar file.
Use the `-d` option to dump the procpar header file contents into the header extension.
Use the `-t` option to set an alternative dimension tag for the 6th dimension (default = `DIM_DYN`).

Note that the varian file format is very flexible -- the binary `fid` itself essentially is a long 2D list of (`complex_points * everything_else`), and the current code makes several significant assumptions about how that should be interpreted and reshaped.
In particular, if you are using a sequence derived from something different to either `spuls`, `s2pul`, `press`, or `steam`, it is quite likely that this will not work. Edit `varian_importer.py` and add cases based on your `seqfil` as appropriate.
It is assumed that the `comment` parameter should be the patient's name.

### Text/LCModel/jMRUI
Conversion from processed formats.
All take an optional -a argument to specify a text file containing a 4x4 affine matrix specifying orientation information.

The text format requires additional information, namely imaging frequency in MHz and bandwidth in hertz.

`spec2nii raw -a AFFINE_FILE FILE`
`spec2nii jmrui -a AFFINE_FILE FILE`
`spec2nii text -a AFFINE_FILE -i imaging_freq -b bandwidth FILE`

### Other functions
Anonymise the NIfTI-MRS file. All standard-defined keys marked as sensitive will be removed. User defined parameters marked as `private_` will also be removed. Use the `-v` flag to view the removed header keys. The `-r` argument may be used (repeatedly) to remove additional keys from the header extension manually.
`spec2nii anon FILE`

Dump the NIfTI headers and header extension to Stdout.
`spec2nii dump FILE`

Produce a json file containing the header extension as a separate file from a NIfTI-MRS file.
`spec2nii extract FILE`

Overwrite the header extension in a NIfTI-MRS file using a separate json formatted file.
`spec2nii insert FILE JSON_FILE`
